The model is designed to take advantage of the massively parallel architecture of a modern supercomputer. The forecast performance of the model is assessed by comparing it to that of daily climatology, persistence, and a numerical (physics-based) model of identical prognostic state variables and resolution. Hourly resolution 20-day forecasts with the model predict realistic values of the atmospheric state variables at all forecast times for the entire globe.

A natural question to ask is whether data-driven methods could also be used to predict global weather patterns days in advance. First studies show promise but the lack of a common data set and evaluation metrics make intercomparison between studies difficult. Here we present a benchmark data set for data-driven medium-range weather forecasting (specifically 3–5 days), a topic of high scientific interest for atmospheric and computer scientists alike. We provide data derived from the ERA5 archive that has been processed to facilitate the use in machine learning models. We propose simple and clear evaluation metrics which will enable a direct comparison between different methods. Further, we provide baseline scores from simple linear regression techniques, deep learning models, as well as purely physical forecasting models. The data set is publicly available at https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench and the companion code is reproducible with tutorials for getting started. We hope that this data set will accelerate research in data-driven weather forecasting.},

	abstract = {Reduced-order dynamical models play a central role in developing our understanding of predictability of climate irrespective of whether we are dealing with the actual climate system or surrogate climate models. In this context, the linear inverse modeling (LIM) approach, by capturing a few essential interactions between dynamical components of the full system, has proven valuable in providing insights into predictability of the full system. We demonstrate that reservoir computing (RC), a form of learning suitable for systems with chaotic dynamics, provides an alternative nonlinear approach that improves on the predictive skill of the LIM approach. We do this in the example setting of predicting sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic in the preindustrial control simulation of a popular earth system model, the Community Earth System Model so that we can compare the performance of the new RC-based approach with the traditional LIM approach both when learning data are plentiful and when such data are more limited. The improved predictive skill of the RC approach over a wide range of conditions—larger number of retained EOF coefficients, extending well into the limited data regime, etc.—suggests that this machine-learning technique may have a use in climate predictability studies. While the possibility of developing a climate emulator—the ability to continue the evolution of the system on the attractor long after failing to be able to track the reference trajectory—is demonstrated in the Lorenz-63 system, it is suggested that further development of the RC approach may permit such uses of the new approach in more realistic predictability studies.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive inter-comparison of linear regression (LR), stochastic, and deep-learning approaches for reduced-order statistical emulation of ocean circulation. The reference data set is provided by an idealized, eddy-resolving, double-gyre ocean circulation model. Our goal is to conduct a systematic and comprehensive assessment and comparison of skill, cost, and complexity of statistical models from the three methodological classes. The model based on LR is considered as a baseline. Additionally, we investigate its additive white noise augmentation and a multi-level stochastic approach, deep-learning methods, hybrid frameworks (LR plus deep-learning), and simple stochastic extensions of deep-learning and hybrid methods. The assessment metrics considered are: root mean squared error, anomaly cross-correlation, climatology, variance, frequency map, forecast horizon, and computational cost. We found that the multi-level linear stochastic approach performs the best for both short- and long-timescale forecasts. The deep-learning hybrid models augmented by additive state-dependent white noise came second, while their deterministic counterparts failed to reproduce the characteristic frequencies in climate-range forecasts. Pure deep learning implementations performed worse than LR and its simple white noise augmentation. Skills of LR and its white noise extension were similar on short timescales, but the latter performed better on long timescales, while LR-only outputs decay to zero for long simulations. Overall, our analysis promotes multi-level LR stochastic models with memory effects, and hybrid models with linear dynamical core augmented by additive stochastic terms learned via deep learning, as a more practical, accurate, and cost-effective option for ocean emulation than pure deep-learning solutions.},

In particular, while most previous applications of reservoir computing have required training on a particular trajectory to further predict the evolution along that trajectory alone, we show the capability of reservoir computing to predict trajectories of the shallow-water equations with initial conditions not seen in the training process. However, in this setting, we find that the performance of the network deteriorates for initial conditions with ambient conditions (such as total water height and average velocity) that are different from those in the training dataset. To circumvent this deficiency, we introduce a transfer learning approach wherein a small additional training step with the relevant ambient conditions is used to improve the predictions.},

FourCastNet matches the forecasting accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure, including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic forecasting.

	abstract = {Reservoir computing is an efficient implementation of a recurrent neural network that can describe the evolution of a dynamical system by supervised machine learning without solving the underlying mathematical equations. In this work, reservoir computing is applied to model the large-scale evolution and the resulting low-order turbulence statistics of a two-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection flow at a Rayleigh number Ra=107 and a Prandtl number Pr=7 in an extended spatial domain with an aspect ratio of 6. Our data-driven approach, which is based on a long-term direct numerical simulation of the convection flow, comprises a two-step procedure: (1) reduction of the original simulation data by a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) snapshot analysis and subsequent truncation to the first 150 POD modes which are associated with the largest total energy amplitudes; (2) setup and optimization of a reservoir computing model to describe the dynamical evolution of these 150 degrees of freedom and thus the large-scale evolution of the convection flow. The quality of the prediction of the reservoir computing model is comprehensively tested by a direct comparison of the results of the original direct numerical simulations and the fields that are reconstructed by means of the POD modes. We find a good agreement of the vertical profiles of mean temperature, mean convective heat flux, and root-mean-square temperature fluctuations. In addition, we discuss temperature variance spectra and joint probability density functions of the turbulent vertical velocity component and temperature fluctuation, the latter of which is essential for the turbulent heat transport across the layer. At the core of the model is the reservoir, a very large sparse random network characterized by the spectral radius of the corresponding adjacency matrix and a few further hyperparameters which are varied to investigate the quality of the prediction. Our work demonstrates that the reservoir computing model is capable of modeling the large-scale structure and low-order statistics of turbulent convection, which can open new avenues for modeling mesoscale convection processes in larger circulation models.},

The method leverages the strengths of two different approaches: empirical modelling based on reservoir computing, which learns the chaotic dynamics from data only, and physical modelling based on conservation laws. This enables the reservoir computing framework to output physical predictions when training data are unavailable. We show that the combination of the two approaches is able to accurately reproduce the velocity statistics, and to predict the occurrence and amplitude of extreme events in a model of self-sustaining process in turbulence. In this flow, the extreme events are abrupt transitions from turbulent to quasi-laminar states, which are deterministic phenomena that cannot be traditionally predicted because of chaos. Furthermore, the physics-constrained machine learning method is shown to be robust with respect to noise. This work opens up new possibilities for synergistically enhancing data-driven methods with physical knowledge for the time-accurate prediction of chaotic flows.},

	abstract = {A downscaled reanalysis for the California Current system is used to construct a low-dimensional linear stochastic emulator of the 3-dimensional time evolving ocean circulation. The approach used is based on balanced truncation which simultaneously draws on information from the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) and stochastic optimals of the ocean state-vector. In this way, balanced truncation faithfully preserves the inherent stability properties of the data, unlike the more traditional approaches based on truncation using EOFs alone. Since balanced truncation is predicated on singular value decomposition, formal error bounds on the accuracy of the reduced-dimension system can be computed. In addition, linear stochastic emulators that target different physical processes can also be constructed, and examples that focus on a region dominated by coastal upwelling are presented. Linear stochastic emulators, such as that developed here, can be exploited to generate very long simulations (or large ensembles) at high resolution that can be used to establish a statistical baseline for important oceanic processes, calculations that would otherwise be very challenging by direct numerical integration. An example is presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract Benchmark datasets and benchmark problems have been a key aspect for the success of modern machine learning applications in many scientific domains. Consequently, an active discussion about benchmarks for applications of machine learning has also started in the atmospheric sciences. Such benchmarks allow for the comparison of machine learning tools and approaches in a quantitative way and enable a separation of concerns for domain and machine learning scientists. However, a clear definition of benchmark datasets for weather and climate applications is missing with the result that many domain scientists are confused. In this paper, we equip the domain of atmospheric sciences with a recipe for how to build proper benchmark datasets, a (nonexclusive) list of domain-specific challenges for machine learning is presented, and it is elaborated where and what benchmark datasets will be needed to tackle these challenges. We hope that the creation of benchmark datasets will help the machine learning efforts in atmospheric sciences to be more coherent, and, at the same time, target the efforts of machine learning scientists and experts of high-performance computing to the most imminent challenges in atmospheric sciences. We focus on benchmarks for atmospheric sciences (weather, climate, and air-quality applications). However, many aspects of this paper will also hold for other aspects of the Earth system sciences or are at least transferable. Significance Statement Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that learn automatically from data. Atmospheric sciences have started to explore sophisticated machine learning techniques and the community is making rapid progress on the uptake of new methods for a large number of application areas. This paper provides a clear definition of so-called benchmark datasets for weather and climate applications that help to share data and machine learning solutions between research groups to reduce time spent in data processing, to generate synergies between groups, and to make tool developments more targeted and comparable. Furthermore, a list of benchmark datasets that will be needed to tackle important challenges for the use of machine learning in atmospheric sciences is provided.},

	abstract = {The field of fluid mechanics is rapidly advancing, driven by unprecedented volumes of data from experiments, field measurements, and large-scale simulations at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations. ML provides a powerful information-processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications.},

	abstract = {A deep spatial transformer based encoder-decoder model has been developed to autoregressively predict the time evolution of the upper layers stream function of a two-layered quasi-geostrophic (QG) system without any information about the lower layers stream function. The spatio-temporal complexity of QG flow is comparable to the complexity of 500hPa Geopotential Height (Z500) of fully coupled climate models or even the Z500 which is observed in the atmosphere, based on the instantaneous attractor dimension metric. The ability to predict autoregressively, the turbulent dynamics of QG is the first step towards building data-driven surrogates for more complex climate models. We show that the equivariance preserving properties of modern spatial transformers incorporated within a convolutional encoder-decoder module can predict up to 9 days in a QG system (outperforming a baseline persistence model and a standard convolutional encoder decoder with a custom loss function). The proposed data-driven model remains stable for multiple years thus promising us of a stable and physical data-driven climate model.},

FourCast-Net is optimized and scales efficiently on three supercomputing systems: Selene, Perlmutter, and JUWELS Booster up to 3,808 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, attaining 140.8 petaFLOPS in mixed precision (11.9\%of peak at that scale). The time-to-solution for training FourCastNet measured on JUWELS Booster on 3,072GPUs is 67.4minutes, resulting in an 80,000times faster time-to-solution relative to state-of-the-art NWP, in inference. FourCastNet produces accurate instantaneous weather predictions for a week in advance, enables enormous ensembles that better capture weather extremes, and supports higher global forecast resolutions.},

	abstract = {There has been much recent interest in developing data-driven models for weather and climate predictions. However, there are open questions regarding their generalizability and robustness, highlighting a need to better understand how they make their predictions. In particular, it is important to understand whether data-driven models learn the underlying physics of the system against which they are trained, or simply identify statistical patterns without any clear link to the underlying physics. In this paper, we describe a sensitivity analysis of a regression-based model of ocean temperature, trained against simulations from a 3D ocean model setup in a very simple configuration. We show that the regressor heavily bases its forecasts on, and is dependent on, variables known to be key to the physics such as currents and density. By contrast, the regressor does not make heavy use of inputs such as location, which have limited direct physical impacts. The model requires nonlinear interactions between inputs in order to show any meaningful skill—in line with the highly nonlinear dynamics of the ocean. Further analysis interprets the ways certain variables are used by the regression model. We see that information about the vertical profile of the water column reduces errors in regions of convective activity, and information about the currents reduces errors in regions dominated by advective processes. Our results demonstrate that even a simple regression model is capable of learning much of the physics of the system being modeled. We expect that a similar sensitivity analysis could be usefully applied to more complex ocean configurations.},

This computationally efficient model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a cubed sphere grid to produce global forecasts. The trained model requires just three minutes on a single GPU to produce a 320-member set of six-week forecasts at 1.4° resolution. Ensemble spread is primarily produced by randomizing the CNN training process to create a set of 32 DLWP models with slightly different learned weights. Although our DLWP model does not forecast precipitation, it does forecast total column water vapor and gives a reasonable 4.5-day deterministic forecast of Hurricane Irma. In addition to simulating mid-latitude weather systems, it spontaneously generates tropical cyclones in a one-year free-running simulation. Averaged globally and over a two-year test set, the ensemble mean RMSE retains skill relative to climatology beyond two-weeks, with anomaly correlation coefficients remaining above 0.6 through six days. Our primary application is to subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting at lead times from two to six weeks. Current forecast systems have low skill in predicting one- or 2-week-average weather patterns at S2S time scales. The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the ranked probability skill score (RPSS) show that the DLWP ensemble is only modestly inferior in performance to the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S ensemble over land at lead times of 4 and 5–6 weeks. At shorter lead times, the ECMWF ensemble performs better than DLWP.},

New developments in this framework include an off-line volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it currently does not compete with operational weather forecasting models, our data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.},

We use the relatively simple general circulation models (GCMs) PUMA and PLASIM as a simplified reality on which we train deep neural networks, which we then use for predicting the model weather at lead times of a few days. We specifically assess how the complexity of the climate model affects the neural network's forecast skill and how dependent the skill is on the length of the provided training period.

At forecast lead times up to 3 days, CNNs trained to predict only 500-hPa geopotential height easily outperform persistence, climatology, and the dynamics-based barotropic vorticity model, but do not beat an operational full-physics weather prediction model. These CNNs are capable of forecasting significant changes in the intensity of weather systems, which is notable because this is beyond the capability of the fundamental dynamical equation that relies solely on 500-hPa data, the barotropic vorticity equation. Modest improvements to the CNN forecasts can be made by adding 700- to 300-hPa thickness to the input data. Our best performing CNN does a good job of capturing the climatology and annual variability of 500-hPa heights and is capable of forecasting realistic atmospheric states at lead times of 14 days. Although our simple models do not perform better than an operational weather model, machine learning warrants further exploration as a weather forecasting tool; in particular, the potential efficiency of CNNs might make them attractive for ensemble forecasting.},

By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

Here, we train a deep residual convolutional neural network (Resnet) to predict geopotential, temperature and precipitation at 5.625° resolution up to 5 days ahead. To avoid overfitting and improve forecast skill, we pretrain the model using historical climate model output before fine-tuning on reanalysis data. The resulting forecasts outperform previous submissions to WeatherBench and are comparable in skill to a physical baseline at similar resolution. We also analyze how the neural network creates its predictions and find that, for the case studies analyzed, the model has learned physically reasonable correlations.

This enables the calculation of both uncertainty and skill metrics for the neural network predictions, and overcomes the common difficulty of inferring uncertainty from these predictions. This approach is data-driven and the neural network is trained on the WeatherBench dataset (processed ERA5 data) to forecast geopotential and temperature 3 and 5 days ahead. Data exploration leads to the identification of the most important input variables. In order to increase computational efficiency, several neural networks are trained on small subsets of these variables. The outputs are then combined through a stacked neural network, the first time such a technique has been applied to weather data. Our approach is found to be more accurate than some coarse numerical weather prediction models and as accurate as more complex alternative neural networks, with the added benefit of providing key probabilistic information necessary for making informed weather forecasts.},

In this article we investigate the applicability of such a framework to geophysical flows, known to involve multiple scales in length, time and energy and to feature intermittency. We show that both multiscale dynamics and intermittency introduce severe limitations to the applicability of recurrent neural networks, both for short-term forecasts as well as for the reconstruction of the underlying attractor. We suggest that possible strategies to overcome such limitations should be based on separating the smooth large-scale dynamics from the intermittent/small-scale features. We test these ideas on global sea-level pressure data for the past 40 years, a proxy of the atmospheric circulation dynamics. Better short- and long-term forecasts of sea-level pressure data can be obtained with an optimal choice of spatial coarse graining and time filtering.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) in geophysical sciences remains the cornerstone of robust forecasts from numerical models. Indeed, DA plays a crucial role in the quality of numerical weather prediction and is a crucial building block that has allowed dramatic improvements in weather forecasting over the past few decades. DA is commonly framed in a variational setting, where one solves an optimization problem within a Bayesian formulation using raw model forecasts as a prior and observations as likelihood. This leads to a DA objective function that needs to be minimized, where the decision variables are the initial conditions speciﬁed to the model. In traditional DA, the forward model is numerically and computationally expensive. Here we replace the forward model with a low-dimensional, data-driven, and differentiable emulator. Consequently, gradients of our DA objective function with respect to the decision variables are obtained rapidly via automatic differentiation. We demonstrate our approach by performing an emulator-assisted DA forecast of geopotential height. Our results indicate that emulatorassisted DA is faster than traditional equation-based DA forecasts by 4 orders of magnitude, allowing computations to be performed on a workstation rather than a dedicated highperformance computer. In addition, we describe accuracy beneﬁts of emulator-assisted DA when compared to simply using the emulator for forecasting (i.e., without DA). Our overall formulation is denoted AIEADA (Artiﬁcial Intelligence Emulator-Assisted Data Assimilation).},

	abstract = {To understand and predict large, complex, and chaotic systems, Earth scientists build simulators from physical laws. Simulators generalize better to new scenarios, require fewer tunable parameters, and are more interpretable than nonphysical deep learning, but procedures for obtaining their derivatives with respect to their inputs are often unavailable. These missing derivatives limit the application of many important tools for forecasting, model tuning, sensitivity analysis, or subgrid-scale parametrization. Here, we propose to overcome this limitation with deep emulator networks that learn to calculate the missing derivatives. By training directly on simulation data without analyzing source code or equations, this approach supports simulators in any programming language on any hardware without specialized routines for each case. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we train emulators on complete or partial system states of the chaotic Lorenz-96 simulator and evaluate the accuracy of their dynamics and derivatives as a function of integration time and training data set size. We further demonstrate that emulator-derived derivatives enable accurate 4D-Var data assimilation and closed-loop training of parametrizations. These results provide a basis for further combining the parsimony and generality of physical models with the power and flexibility of machine learning.},

There is some evidence that better weather forecasts can be produced by introducing big data mining and neural networks into the weather prediction workflow. Here, we discuss the question of whether it is possible to completely replace the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with DL approaches. This discussion entails a review of state-of-the-art machine learning concepts and their applicability to weather data with its pertinent statistical properties. We think that it is not inconceivable that numerical weather models may one day become obsolete, but a number of fundamental breakthroughs are needed before this goal comes into reach.

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

Here we describe the development of the Met Office Global Coupled Model version 2 (GC2) with increased resolution relative to the standard model: the ocean resolution is increased from 1/4 to 1/12° (28 to 9 km at the Equator), the atmosphere resolution increased from 60 km (N216) to 25 km (N512) and the coupling period reduced from 3 hourly to hourly. The technical developments that were required to build a version of the model at higher resolution are described as well as results from a 20-year simulation. The results demonstrate the key role played by the enhanced resolution of the ocean model: reduced sea surface temperature (SST) biases, improved ocean heat transports, deeper and stronger overturning circulation and a stronger Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our results suggest that the improvements seen here require high resolution in both atmosphere and ocean components as well as high-frequency coupling. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that ocean resolution is an important consideration when developing coupled models for weather and climate applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our model reduction method uses a reduced basis approach, which requires the computation of high-fidelity solutions at a number of sample points throughout the parametric input space. A key challenge that must be addressed in the optimization, control, and probabilistic settings is the need for the reduced models to capture variation over this parametric input space, which, for many applications, will be of high dimension. We pose the task of determining appropriate sample points as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, which is implemented using an efficient adaptive algorithm that scales well to systems with a large number of parameters. The methodology is demonstrated using examples with parametric input spaces of dimension 11 and 21, which describe thermal analysis and design of a heat conduction fin, and compared with statistically based sampling methods. For these examples, the model-constrained adaptive sampling leads to reduced models that, for a given basis size, have error several orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained using the other methods.},

Our framework employs a Bayesian statistical setting, which provides a foundation for inference from noisy, indirect, and incomplete data, and a natural mechanism for incorporating heterogeneous sources of information. An objective function is constructed from information theoretic measures, reflecting expected information gain from proposed combinations of experiments. Polynomial chaos approximations and a two-stage Monte Carlo sampling method are used to evaluate the expected information gain. Stochastic approximation algorithms are then used to make optimization feasible in computationally intensive and high-dimensional settings.

The technique can be applied to interpret sets of observed time series or numerical simulations with high-resolution models, or to relate observation and simulations. The method is based on a projection of the complete system on to a smaller number of “principal interaction patterns” (PIPs). The coefficients of the PIP expansion are assumed to be governed by a dynamic model containing a small number of adjustable parameters. The optimization of the dynamical model, which in the general case can be both nonlinear and time-dependent, is carried out simultaneously with the construction of the optimal set of interaction patterns. In the linear case the PIPs reduce to the eigenoscilations of a first-order linear vector process with stochastic forcing (principal oscillation patterns, or POPs). POPs are linearly related to the “principal prediction patterns” used in linear forecasting applications. The POP analysis can also be applied as a diagnostic tool to compress the extensive information contained in the high-dimensional cross-spectral covariance matrix representing the complete second-moment structure of the system.},

	abstract = {A reservoir computer (RC) is a type of recurrent neural network architecture with demonstrated success in the prediction of spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems. A further advantage of RC is that it reproduces intrinsic dynamical quantities essential for its incorporation into numerical forecasting routines such as the ensemble Kalman filter—used in numerical weather prediction to compensate for sparse and noisy data. We explore here the architecture and design choices for a “best in class” RC for a number of characteristic dynamical systems. Our analysis points to the importance of large scale parameter optimization. We also note in particular the importance of including input bias in the RC design, which has a significant impact on the forecast skill of the trained RC model. In our tests, the use of a nonlinear readout operator does not affect the forecast time or the stability of the forecast. The effects of the reservoir dimension, spinup time, amount of training data, normalization, noise, and the RC time step are also investigated. Finally, we detail how our investigation leads to optimal design choices for a parallel RC scheme applied to the 40 dimensional spatiotemporally chaotic Lorenz 1996 dynamics.},

A scheme that accomplishes this is called an “observer.” We consider the case in which a model of the system is unavailable or insufficiently accurate, but “training” time series data of the desired state variables are available for a short period of time, and a limited number of other system variables are continually measured. We propose a solution to this problem using networks of neuron-like units known as “reservoir computers.” The measurements that are continually available are input to the network, which is trained with the limited-time data to output estimates of the desired state variables. We demonstrate our method, which we call a “reservoir observer,” using the Rössler system, the Lorenz system, and the spatiotemporally chaotic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation. Subject to the condition of observability (i.e., whether it is in principle possible, by any means, to infer the desired unmeasured variables from the measured variables), we show that the reservoir observer can be a very effective and versatile tool for robustly reconstructing unmeasured dynamical system variables.},

Importantly, it requires very small training data sets, uses linear optimization, and thus requires minimal computing resources. However, the algorithm uses randomly sampled matrices to define the underlying recurrent neural network and has a multitude of metaparameters that must be optimized. Recent results demonstrate the equivalence of reservoir computing to nonlinear vector autoregression, which requires no random matrices, fewer metaparameters, and provides interpretable results. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear vector autoregression excels at reservoir computing benchmark tasks and requires even shorter training data sets and training time, heralding the next generation of reservoir computing.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has become a widely popular and successful paradigm, especially in data-driven science and engineering. A major application problem is data-driven forecasting of future states from a complex dynamical system. Artificial neural networks have evolved as a clear leader among many machine learning approaches, and recurrent neural networks are considered to be particularly well suited for forecasting dynamical systems. In this setting, the echo-state networks or reservoir computers (RCs) have emerged for their simplicity and computational complexity advantages. Instead of a fully trained network, an RC trains only readout weights by a simple, efficient least squares method. What is perhaps quite surprising is that nonetheless, an RC succeeds in making high quality forecasts, competitively with more intensively trained methods, even if not the leader. There remains an unanswered question as to why and how an RC works at all despite randomly selected weights. To this end, this work analyzes a further simplified RC, where the internal activation function is an identity function. Our simplification is not presented for the sake of tuning or improving an RC, but rather for the sake of analysis of what we take to be the surprise being not that it does not work better, but that such random methods work at all. We explicitly connect the RC with linear activation and linear readout to well developed time-series literature on vector autoregressive (VAR) averages that includes theorems on representability through the Wold theorem, which already performs reasonably for short-term forecasts. In the case of a linear activation and now popular quadratic readout RC, we explicitly connect to a nonlinear VAR, which performs quite well. Furthermore, we associate this paradigm to the now widely popular dynamic mode decomposition; thus, these three are in a sense different faces of the same thing. We illustrate our observations in terms of popular benchmark examples including Mackey–Glass differential delay equations and the Lorenz63 system.},

Individual descriptions of these techniques exist, but a overview is still lacking. Here, we present a series of experimental results that compares all three implementations, and draw conclusions about the relation between a broad range of reservoir parameters and network dynamics, memory, node complexity and performance on a variety of benchmark tests with different characteristics. Next, we introduce a new measure for the reservoir dynamics based on Lyapunov exponents. Unlike previous measures in the literature, this measure is dependent on the dynamics of the reservoir in response to the inputs, and in the cases we tried, it indicates an optimal value for the global scaling of the weight matrix, irrespective of the standard measures. We also describe the Reservoir Computing Toolbox that was used for these experiments, which implements all the types of Reservoir Computing and allows the easy simulation of a wide range of reservoir topologies for a number of benchmarks.},

During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property (ESP), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the ESP, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard ESNs. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator ESNs. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},

	abstract = {We examine the efficiency of Recurrent Neural Networks in forecasting the spatiotemporal dynamics of high dimensional and reduced order complex systems using Reservoir Computing (RC) and Backpropagation through time (BPTT) for gated network architectures. We highlight advantages and limitations of each method and discuss their implementation for parallel computing architectures. We quantify the relative prediction accuracy of these algorithms for the long-term forecasting of chaotic systems using as benchmarks the Lorenz-96 and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equations. We find that, when the full state dynamics are available for training, RC outperforms BPTT approaches in terms of predictive performance and in capturing of the long-term statistics, while at the same time requiring much less training time. However, in the case of reduced order data, large scale RC models can be unstable and more likely than the BPTT algorithms to diverge. In contrast, RNNs trained via BPTT show superior forecasting abilities and capture well the dynamics of reduced order systems. Furthermore, the present study quantifies for the first time the Lyapunov Spectrum of the KS equation with BPTT, achieving similar accuracy as RC. This study establishes that RNNs are a potent computational framework for the learning and forecasting of complex spatiotemporal systems.},

To achieve this, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are implemented as pretrained surrogate models to replace key components of the DA cycle in numerical weather prediction (NWP), including the conventional numerical forecast model, the forecast error covariance matrix, and the tangent linear and adjoint models. It is shown how these RNNs can be initialized using DA methods to directly update the hidden/reservoir state with observations of the target system. The results indicate that these techniques can be applied to estimate the state of a system for the repeated initialization of short-term forecasts, even in the absence of a traditional numerical forecast model. Further, it is demonstrated how these integrated RNN-DA methods can scale to higher dimensions by applying domain localization and parallelization, providing a path for practical applications in NWP.},

	abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

	abstract = {Reservoir Computing (RC) is a simple and efficient model-free framework for data-driven predictions of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) has emerged as an especially attractive variant of RC. By shifting the nonlinearity from the reservoir to the readout layer, NGRC requires less data and has fewer hyperparameters to optimize, making it suitable for challenging tasks such as predicting basins of attraction. Here, using paradigmatic multistable systems including magnetic pendulums and coupled Kuramoto oscillators, we show that the performance of NGRC models can be extremely sensitive to the choice of readout nonlinearity. In particular, by incorporating the exact nonlinearity from the original equations, NGRC trained on a single trajectory can predict pseudo-fractal basins with almost perfect accuracy. However, even a small uncertainty on the exact nonlinearity can completely break NGRC, rendering the prediction accuracy no better than chance. This creates a catch-22 for NGRC since it may not be able to make useful predictions unless a key part of the system being predicted (i.e., its nonlinearity) is already known. Our results highlight the challenges faced by data-driven methods in learning complex dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract The quasigeostrophic equations consist of the advection of linearized potential vorticity coupled with advection of temperature at the bounding upper and lower surfaces. Numerical models of quasigeostrophic flow often employ greater (scaled) resolution in the horizontal than in the vertical (the two-layer model is an extreme example). In the interior, this has the effect of suppressing interactions between layers at horizontal scales that are small compared to Nδz/f (where δz is the vertical resolution, N the buoyancy frequency, and f the Coriolis parameter). The nature of the turbulent cascade in the interior is, however, not fundamentally altered because the downscale cascade of potential enstrophy in quasigeostrophic turbulence and the downscale cascade of enstrophy in two-dimensional turbulence (occurring layerwise) both yield energy spectra with slopes of −3. It is shown here that a similar restriction on the vertical resolution applies to the representation of horizontal motions at the surfaces, but the penalty for underresolving in the vertical is complete suppression of the surface temperature cascade at small scales and a corresponding artificial steepening of the surface energy spectrum. This effect is demonstrated in the nonlinear Eady model, using a finite-difference representation in comparison with a model that explicitly advects temperature at the upper and lower surfaces. Theoretical predictions for the spectrum of turbulence in the nonlinear Eady model are reviewed and compared to the simulated flows, showing that the latter model yields an accurate representation of the cascade dynamics. To accurately represent dynamics at horizontal wavenumber K in the vertically finite-differenced model, it is found that the vertical grid spacing must satisfy δz ≲ 0.3f/(NK); at wavenumbers K {\textgreater} 0.3f/(Nδz), the spectrum of temperature variance rolls off rapidly.},

In the quasi-geostrophic system, conservation of total energy and conservation of available potential energy on plane rigid horizontal boundaries imply a restriction on energy exchanges as a result of scale interactions. It is shown that for the Eady problem instability is always associated with energy transfer both up and down the vertical wavenumber spectrum although energy transfer from small to large three-dimensional wavenumbers may occur over a finite range of the spectrum. An inertial theory of two-dimensional turbulence is also presented. The formal analysis, based on Leith's diffusion approximation, predicts two inertial subranges: −5/3 and −1 power dependences on the horizontal wavenumber for available potential energy on horizontal boundaries. In the former range, available potential energy on horizontal boundaries cascades at a constant rate toward higher wavenumbers; in the latter range, the depth-integrated total energy cascades at a constant rate toward lower wavenumbers. Analysis of the semi-geostrophic equations, in the form presented by Hoskins, shows that a formal analogy exists between energy exchanges in this system and energy exchanges in the quasi-geostrophic system. The transformation back to physical space reveals that the mean strain rate, due to vertical wind shear, affects the complete spectrum of interacting waves. This latter result brings the concept of a local inertial energy transfer theory of turbulence for synoptic- and subsynoptic-scale motions into question, although it is concluded that further analysis and observational evidence would be required to resolve the problem.},

In all the cases examined there exists one particular component which grows faster than any other. It is shown how, by a process analogous to “natural selection”, this component becomes dominant in that almost any disturbance tends eventually to a definite size, structure and growth-rate (and to a characteristic life-history after the disturbance has ceased to be “small”), which depends only on the broad characteristics of the initial (unperturbed) system. The characteristic disturbances (forms of breakdown) of certain types of initial system (approximating to those observed in practice) are identified as the ideal forms of the observed cyclonc waves and long waves of middle and high latitudes.

In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

It also includes unique surrogate models: kriging by partial least-squares reduction, which scales well with the number of inputs; and energy-minimizing spline interpolation, which scales well with the number of training points. The efficiency and effectiveness of SMT are demonstrated through a series of examples. SMT is documented using custom tools for embedding automatically tested code and dynamically generated plots to produce high-quality user guides with minimal effort from contributors.

In recent years, a research line from Fourier analysis sheds lights into this magical "black box" by showing a Frequency Principle (F-Principle or spectral bias) of the training behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs) -- DNNs often fit functions from low to high frequency during the training. The F-Principle is first demonstrated by one-dimensional synthetic data followed by the verification in high-dimensional real datasets. A series of works subsequently enhance the validity of the F-Principle. This low-frequency implicit bias reveals the strength of neural network in learning low-frequency functions as well as its deficiency in learning high-frequency functions. Such understanding inspires the design of DNN-based algorithms in practical problems, explains experimental phenomena emerging in various scenarios, and further advances the study of deep learning from the frequency perspective. Although incomplete, we provide an overview of F-Principle and propose some open problems for future research.},

	abstract = {We introduce a machine-learning (ML)-based weather simulator--called "GraphCast"--which outperforms the most accurate deterministic operational medium-range weather forecasting system in the world, as well as all previous ML baselines. GraphCast is an autoregressive model, based on graph neural networks and a novel high-resolution multi-scale mesh representation, which we trained on historical weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ERA5 reanalysis archive. It can make 10-day forecasts, at 6-hour time intervals, of five surface variables and six atmospheric variables, each at 37 vertical pressure levels, on a 0.25-degree latitude-longitude grid, which corresponds to roughly 25 x 25 kilometer resolution at the equator. Our results show GraphCast is more accurate than ECMWF's deterministic operational forecasting system, HRES, on 90.0\% of the 2760 variable and lead time combinations we evaluated. GraphCast also outperforms the most accurate previous ML-based weather forecasting model on 99.2\% of the 252 targets it reported. GraphCast can generate a 10-day forecast (35 gigabytes of data) in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU v4 hardware. Unlike traditional forecasting methods, ML-based forecasting scales well with data: by training on bigger, higher quality, and more recent data, the skill of the forecasts can improve. Together these results represent a key step forward in complementing and improving weather modeling with ML, open new opportunities for fast, accurate forecasting, and help realize the promise of ML-based simulation in the physical sciences.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present Pangu-Weather, a deep learning based system for fast and accurate global weather forecast. For this purpose, we establish a data-driven environment by downloading \$43\$ years of hourly global weather data from the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and train a few deep neural networks with about \$256\$ million parameters in total. The spatial resolution of forecast is \$0.25{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}times0.25{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, comparable to the ECMWF Integrated Forecast Systems (IFS). More importantly, for the first time, an AI-based method outperforms state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods in terms of accuracy (latitude-weighted RMSE and ACC) of all factors (e.g., geopotential, specific humidity, wind speed, temperature, etc.) and in all time ranges (from one hour to one week). There are two key strategies to improve the prediction accuracy: (i) designing a 3D Earth Specific Transformer (3DEST) architecture that formulates the height (pressure level) information into cubic data, and (ii) applying a hierarchical temporal aggregation algorithm to alleviate cumulative forecast errors. In deterministic forecast, Pangu-Weather shows great advantages for short to medium-range forecast (i.e., forecast time ranges from one hour to one week). Pangu-Weather supports a wide range of downstream forecast scenarios, including extreme weather forecast (e.g., tropical cyclone tracking) and large-member ensemble forecast in real-time. Pangu-Weather not only ends the debate on whether AI-based methods can surpass conventional NWP methods, but also reveals novel directions for improving deep learning weather forecast systems.},

Making accurate high-resolution precipitation forecasts using traditional physical models remains a major challenge in operational weather forecasting as they incur substantial computational costs and struggle to achieve sufficient forecast skill. Recently, deep-learning-based models have shown great promise in closing the gap with numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in terms of precipitation forecast skill, opening up exciting new avenues for precipitation modeling. However, it is challenging for these deep learning models to fully resolve the fine-scale structures of precipitation phenomena and adequately characterize the extremes of the long-tailed precipitation distribution. In this work, we present several improvements to the architecture and training process of a current state-of-the art deep learning precipitation model (FourCastNet) using a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) to better capture fine scales and extremes. Our improvements achieve superior performance in capturing the extreme percentiles of global precipitation, while comparable to state-of-the-art NWP models in terms of forecast skill at 1--2 day lead times. Together, these improvements set a new state-of-the-art in global precipitation forecasting.},

Our direct numerical simulation model describes a convective boundary layer in a simple way. The data are used to train and test a recurrent neural network in the form of an echo state network. The input of the echo state network is obtained in two different ways, either by a proper orthogonal decomposition or by a convolutional autoencoder. In both cases, the echo state network reproduces the turbulence dynamics and the statistical properties of the buoyancy flux, and is able to model unseen data records with different flux ratios.},

	abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESN) are a type of Recurrent Neural Networks that yields promising results in representing time series and nonlinear dynamic systems. Although they are equipped with a very efficient training procedure, Reservoir Computing strategies, such as the ESN, require the use of high order networks, i.e. large number of layers, resulting in number of states that is magnitudes higher than the number of model inputs and outputs. This not only makes the computation of a time step more costly, but also may pose robustness issues when applying ESNs to problems such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and other optimal control problems. One such way to circumvent this is through Model Order Reduction strategies such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and its variants (POD-DEIM), whereby we find an equivalent lower order representation to an already trained high dimension ESN. The objective of this work is to investigate and analyze the performance of POD methods in Echo State Networks, evaluating their effectiveness. To this end, we evaluate the Memory Capacity (MC) of the POD-reduced network in comparison to the original (full order) ENS. We also perform experiments on two different numerical case studies: a NARMA10 difference equation and an oil platform containing two wells and one riser. The results show that there is little loss of performance comparing the original ESN to a POD-reduced counterpart, and also that the performance of a POD-reduced ESN tend to be superior to a normal ESN of the same size. Also we attain speedups of around \$80{\textbackslash}\%\$ in comparison to the original ESN.},

Starting from a large, task-effective reservoir matrix, we form a controllability matrix whose rank indicates the active sub-manifold and candidate replacement reservoir size. Resulting time speed-ups and reduced memory usage come with minimal error increase to chaotic climate reconstruction or short term prediction. Experiments are performed on simple time series signals and the Lorenz-1963 and Mackey–Glass complex chaotic signals.

	abstract = {As a recurrent neural network that requires no training, the reservoir computing (RC) model has attracted widespread attention in the last decade, especially in the context of time series prediction. However, most time series have a multiscale structure, which a single-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple projection-encoding hierarchical reservoir computing framework called Deep Projection-encoding Echo State Network (DeePr-ESN). The most distinctive feature of our model is its ability to learn multiscale dynamics through stacked ESNs, connected via subspace projections. Specifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., an autoencoder or PCA) projects the echo-state representations into a lower-dimensional feature space. These representations are the principal components of the echo-state representations, which removes the high frequency components of the representations. These can then be processed by another ESN through random connections. By using projection layers and encoding layers alternately, our DeePr-ESN can provide much more robust generalization performance than previous methods, and also fully takes advantage of the temporal kernel property of ESNs to encode the multiscale dynamics of time series. In our experiments, the DeePr-ESNs outperform both standard ESNs and existing hierarchical reservoir computing models on some artificial and real-world time series prediction tasks.},

	abstract = {Reservoir computing (RC) offers efficient temporal data processing with a low training cost by separating recurrent neural networks into a fixed network with recurrent connections and a trainable linear network. The quality of the fixed network, called reservoir, is the most important factor that determines the performance of the RC system. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the hierarchical reservoir structure on the properties of the reservoir and the performance of the RC system. Analogous to deep neural networks, stacking sub-reservoirs in series is an efficient way to enhance the nonlinearity of data transformation to high-dimensional space and expand the diversity of temporal information captured by the reservoir. These deep reservoir systems offer better performance when compared to simply increasing the size of the reservoir or the number of sub-reservoirs. Low frequency components are mainly captured by the sub-reservoirs in later stage of the deep reservoir structure, similar to observations that more abstract information can be extracted by layers in the late stage of deep neural networks. When the total size of the reservoir is fixed, tradeoff between the number of sub-reservoirs and the size of each sub-reservoir needs to be carefully considered, due to the degraded ability of individual sub-reservoirs at small sizes. Improved performance of the deep reservoir structure alleviates the difficulty of implementing the RC system on hardware systems.},

In particular, the analysis aims at the study and proposal of approaches to develop and enhance hierarchical dynamics in deep architectures within the efficient Reservoir Computing (RC) framework for RNN modeling. The effect of a deep layered organization of RC models is investigated in terms of both occurrence of multiple time-scale and increasing of richness of the dynamics. It turns out that a deep layering of recurrent models allows an effective diversification of temporal representations in the layers of the hierarchy, by amplifying the effects of the factors influencing the time-scales and the richness of the dynamics, measured as the entropy of recurrent units activations. The advantages of the proposed approach are also highlighted by measuring the increment of the short-term memory capacity of the RC models.},

ESNs have greatly facilitated the real-time application of RNN, and have been shown to outperform classical approaches in a number of benchmark tasks. In this paper, we introduce novel criteria for integrating multiple layers of reservoirs within an echo state machine, with the resulting architecture termed the ML-ESM.

There is a formal resemblance to two-dimensional flow, with surface temperature playing the role of vorticity, but a different relationship between the flow and the advected scalar creates several distinctive features. A series of examples are described which highlight some of these features: the evolution of an elliptical vortex; the start-up vortex shed by flow over a mountain; the instability of temperature filaments; the ‘edge wave’ critical layer; and mixing in an overturning edge wave. Characteristics of the direct cascade of the tracer variance to small scales in homogeneous turbulence, as well as the inverse energy cascade, are also described. In addition to its geophysical relevance, the ubiquitous generation of secondary instabilities and the possibility of finite-time collapse make this system a potentially important, numerically tractable, testbed for turbulence theories.},

Existing tools are usually either accurate or efficient, but not both. This paper presents a tool that can analyze airfoils in both subsonic and transonic regimes in about one-hundredth of a second, and optimize airfoil shapes in a few seconds. Camber and thickness mode shapes derived from over 1000 existing airfoils are used to parameterize the airfoil shape, which reduces the number of design variables. More than 100,000 Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) evaluations associated with different airfoils and flow conditions are used to train a surrogate model that combines gradient-enhanced kriging, partial least squares, and mixture of experts. These surrogate models provide fast aerodynamic analysis and gradient computation, which are coupled with a gradient-based optimizer to perform rapid airfoil shape design optimization. When comparing the surrogate-based optimization with optimization based on direct RANS evaluations, the largest differences in minimum

To drastically reduce the computational time of both analysis and design optimization, we use machine learning to create a model of a wide range of possible airfoils at a range of flight conditions, making it possible to perform airfoil design optimization in a few seconds. The machine learning consists of gradient-enhanced artificial neural networks where the gradient information is phased in gradually. This new gradient-enhanced artificial neural network approach is trained to model the aerodynamic force coefficients of airfoils in both subsonic and transonic regimes. The aerodynamics is modeled with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The proposed approach outperforms an existing airfoil model that uses a mixture of experts technique combined with a gradient-based kriging surrogate model. The approach yields to similar airfoil shape optimization solutions than high-fidelity CFD optimization solutions with a difference of 0.01 count and 0.12 count for Cd in subsonic and transonic regimes, respectively. Airfoil optimization problems are solved in a few seconds (instead of hours using CFD-based optimization), making the design process much more interactive, as demonstrated in the Webfoil airfoil design optimization tool.},

These subgrid parameterizations can be powerfully designed using physics and/or data-driven methods, with uncertainty quantification. For example, Guillaumin and Zanna (2021) proposed a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts subgrid forcing and its local uncertainty. The major assumption and potential drawback of this model is the statistical independence of stochastic residuals between grid points. Here, we aim to improve the simulation of stochastic forcing with generative models of ML, such as Generative adversarial network (GAN) and Variational autoencoder (VAE). Generative models learn the distribution of subgrid forcing conditioned on the resolved flow directly from data and they can produce new samples from this distribution. Generative models can potentially capture not only the spatial correlation but any statistically significant property of subgrid forcing. We test the proposed stochastic parameterizations offline and online in an idealized ocean model. We show that generative models are able to predict subgrid forcing and its uncertainty with spatially correlated stochastic forcing. Online simulations for a range of resolutions demonstrated that generative models are superior to the baseline ML model at the coarsest resolution.},

	abstract = {The immense computational cost of traditional numerical weather and climate models has sparked the development of machine learning (ML) based emulators. Because ML methods benefit from long records of training data, it is common to use datasets that are temporally subsampled relative to the time steps required for the numerical integration of differential equations. Here, we investigate how this often overlooked processing step affects the quality of an emulator's predictions. We implement two ML architectures from a class of methods called reservoir computing: (1) a form of Nonlinear Vector Autoregression (NVAR), and (2) an Echo State Network (ESN). Despite their simplicity, it is well documented that these architectures excel at predicting low dimensional chaotic dynamics. We are therefore motivated to test these architectures in an idealized setting of predicting high dimensional geophysical turbulence as represented by Surface Quasi-Geostrophic dynamics. In all cases, subsampling the training data consistently leads to an increased bias at small spatial scales that resembles numerical diffusion. Interestingly, the NVAR architecture becomes unstable when the temporal resolution is increased, indicating that the polynomial based interactions are insufficient at capturing the detailed nonlinearities of the turbulent flow. The ESN architecture is found to be more robust, suggesting a benefit to the more expensive but more general structure. Spectral errors are reduced by including a penalty on the kinetic energy density spectrum during training, although the subsampling related errors persist. Future work is warranted to understand how the temporal resolution of training data affects other ML architectures.},
